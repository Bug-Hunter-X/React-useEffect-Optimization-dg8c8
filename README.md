# Unnecessary Re-renders in React useEffect Hook
This repository demonstrates a common React bug where the `useEffect` hook runs more frequently than intended due to missing dependencies in the dependency array. This can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior. 
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.
